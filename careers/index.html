			<h3>
				Why work for us?
			</h3>
			<h4>A bit about orchestrated</h4>
			<p>
				We began our journey in 2014 for the purpose of empowering large corporations with the tools and processes needed to affect digital transformation, and since then have expanded to provide multiple services across Melbourne and Sydney.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are a young growing company with an exciting future with an empowered collaborative culture. We are looking to grow to be able to expand our offerings even further and increase the speed at which we can deliver meaningful value to our clients. We are a bunch of passionate and talented individuals and so we are looking for more of the same to help us in this endeavour.
			</p>
			<h4>Our culture</h4>
			<p>
				We really value our employees. And this isn't just marketing talk, the proof is in the pudding; regular (work-paid) outings revolving around food, coffee or a cold brew are a common occurance (we are foodies and like to be social about it), quarterly offsite workshops for the whole company, fun social events, christmas parties, conferences, talks, the works. And because we care about work life balance, we are flexible with working hours, every staff is given the autonomy to manage their own time and be responsible and acountable for their own work; we treat you like adults, not children telling you what you can and can't do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our culture is fun and relaxed, but we know our business, and are self driven and motivated to conquer any challenge and succeed. Everyone is accountable and responsible for their own deliverables. Collaboration and knowledge sharing is encouraged, not just within our company, but in working with our clients as well.
			</p>
			<h4 class="about__keyValues">OUR KEY VALUES</h4>
			<ul class="about__valueList">
				<li class="about__value">Collaborate to continuously deliver customer value</li>
				<li class="about__value">Passionate about software engineering and digital transformation</li>
				<li class="about__value">Continually learn and share your learnings</li>
				<li class="about__value">Work without blame and challenge the status quo</li>
				<li class="about__value">Choose facetime first</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As a whole, we embrace these values, and are continuously looking for people who could see themselves as a fit for these values and mindset.
